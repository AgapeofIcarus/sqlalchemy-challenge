For this project, we are analyzing climate patterns for a vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To do so, the following had to be done:

* Query 12 months of precipitation data.
* Find the station with the highest number of observations.
* With that station's data, calculate the highest, lowest, and average temperatures.
* Retrieve 12 months of temperature data for this station.
* Create an app python file to filter and display the information we have found.
